# Frontend

The Sppd.TeamTuner frontend is a [Vue 2](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) application.



## UI components
Please use components from this list if possible:
- [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/): Main UI components library.
- [vue-toasted](https://github.com/shakee93/vue-toasted): Display toast messages.
- [vue-bootstrap-typeahead](https://github.com/alexurquhart/vue-bootstrap-typeahead): Typeahead control.

Additionally, these components are being used:
- [vue-sidebar-menu](https://github.com/yaminncco/vue-sidebar-menu): the side bar.

## Icons
The free [Font Awsome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon set is included in version 5.11.2.

## Structure
- A view uses components and services
- Services use api.ts to execute API calls

### Files and folders

- [main.ts](./src/main.ts): imports external libraries which will be available globally and instantiates the single Vue application.
- [App.vue](./src/App.vue): sets up the main page with the navigation bar, sidebar and router view. It also sets up the axios defaults on creation.
- [router.ts](./src/router.ts): defines the entire application routing.
- [api.ts](./src/api.ts): API clients, using axios, autogenerated by NSwag, using the cake target `Frontend-Generate-API-Client`.

- [_constats](./src/_constants): Static constants used throughout the frontend.
- [_helpers](./src/_helpers): Helpers.
- [_services](./src/_services): Services, usually using api.ts to access the API.
- [components](./src/components): Vue components which are being used by views.
- [plugins](./src/plugins): Imports external components.
- [views](./src/views): Vue views. They must be registered with the router.

## Configuration
The only configuration having to be set is the API URL, which is being set in [index.html](./public/index.html):
```
<meta id="apiUrl" content="https://localhost:44336/" />
```

Note that the URL does not have to be changed for development as the backend will be available by default on this URL (see [launchSettings.json](../Backend/Sppd.TeamTuner/Properties/launchSettings.json)).
